# Contributing to TaskTaskRevolution

## A Personal Project

Thank you for your interest in contributing to TaskTaskRevolution!

This project is currently maintained as a personal portfolio piece and a learning ground for exploring concepts in Rust, Domain-Driven Design, and Clean Architecture. Due to its nature as a personal and actively evolving project, **I am not accepting external contributions at this time.**

This allows me to freely experiment with the architecture and features without the overhead of managing pull requests, issues, and contributor guidelines.

## Project Structure

If you are curious about the project's design, it follows the principles of **Clean Architecture** and **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**. The code is organized into the following layers:

-   **Domain**: Contains the core business logic, entities, and rules.
-   **Application**: Implements the application's use cases, orchestrating the domain layer.
-   **Infrastructure**: Provides concrete implementations for persistence (like file system access) and other external concerns.
-   **Interface**: Manages user interaction (the command-line interface).
